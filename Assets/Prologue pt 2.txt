The Sun, as it weakened, gathered a single drop of its light into an arrow and shot it into the blackened sky, and the Moon, pale in comparison, formed itself in the darkness. Death, occupied with consuming the Sun, did not see the Moon’s light until its beams dragged it, bound, back to the depths of the End of the World. The Moon, to sate Death’s anger, agreed that every living thing would one day die, and that their souls would be sent to the sea, where Death could claim them. Death agreed, and drew itself back from the lands and the sky.
