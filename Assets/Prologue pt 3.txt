The Moon drew strength from the islands as they appeared, until its light shown through the remains of Death’s streaked sky and cleared the waters as the souls found new life, and life returned to the ground. People grew, life returned, and other gods formed in the midst of the budding world. 
Thus The Isles came to be, and for many ages, we have flourished and Death has laid calm, wrapped by the Moon’s chains and sated by our rites.
